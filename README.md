# Give-N-Get-Hub
 
## Overview 🌟
According to the well-known story of a man with a difficult financial situation who gets a house as a result of exchanging much stuff, starting from a red paper clip📎, then a door handle and a food grill, until he exchanged a role in a movie for a house 🏡. From this story, our website was born to open the business door for everyone. This website is a good point for anyone to start his/her own business. They don't need capital (money💵); all they need is something they don't want but that has real value to others, so instead of throwing it out where no one will use it, make it your joker card 🃏 and enter the market with it. Even if you don't have anything tangible to provide, that must not stop you because our website extends your chances of entering the market by allowing you to pay by your time 🕑 so that you can provide a service to get the product that you want. With our website, there is no place for excuses to start your business and fulfill your dreams! 🌠 

## Project Structure 📂
In general, the website offers three main services: "Borrow Products," "Exchange Products," and "Gift Products." Additionally, the website provides discount coupons to incentivize customers to utilize its services. 🔥
