# Give-N-Get-Hub 🎁
 
## Overview 🌟
According to the well-known story of a man with a difficult financial situation who gets a house as a result of exchanging much stuff, starting from a red paper clip📎, then a door handle and a food grill, until he exchanged a role in a movie for a house 🏡. From this story, our website was born to open the business door for everyone. This website is a good point for anyone to start his/her own business. They don't need capital (money💵); all they need is something they don't want but that has real value to others, so instead of throwing it out where no one will use it, make it your joker card 🃏 and enter the market with it. Even if you don't have anything tangible to provide, that must not stop you because our website extends your chances of entering the market by allowing you to pay by your time 🕑 so that you can provide a service to get the product that you want. With our website, there is no place for excuses to start your business and fulfill your dreams! 

### Project Structure 🛠
In general, the website offers three main services: "Borrow Products," "Exchange Products," and "Gift Products." Additionally, the website provides discount coupons to incentivize customers to utilize its services. 🔥

## Project Artifacts 📂
The report investigates the process of building this system, beginning with the search for an idea and identifying its purpose and potential impact on society. This is followed by a **comprehensive analysis of a similar system**, including an assessment of its shortcomings and areas for improvement. Then, the analysis phase was started. During this phase, the **functional and non-functional requirements** were elicited, along with some of the analysis design, such as use case and activity diagrams. Next, we moved to the design phase, where the functionality of the system was visualized using some **UML diagrams** as well as the **overall architecture**, including the MVC and client-server patterns, were selected. The system was then brought to life in the **development phase**. At the end, we went through some **test cases to test the functionality** of the system and to see if it fit the purpose. Finally, the **system was deployed**.

*This website was developed using the **Waterfall methodology**.
